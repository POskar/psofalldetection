# ACIT4630 Student Project

In this project, we present a comprehensive fall detection system developed using a combination of machine learning techniques, including Random Forests, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The system is designed to accurately and efficiently recognize falls, aiming to reduce the risks and adverse consequences associated with unattended fall incidents. We employ Random Forests for feature importance determination, providing a robust mechanism to identify the most significant characteristics contributing to fall detection. Subsequently, we train both ANNs and RNNs, leveraging their respective strengths in handling complex patterns and temporal data dependencies, to create a more accurate and reliable fall detection model. Furthermore, to ensure the optimal configuration of our models, we utilize Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for hyperparameter tuning and architectural optimization of both the ANN and RNN. Through this approach, we successfully locate superior model architectures, which exhibit enhanced performance in fall detection tasks. The proposed system provides a promising solution for real-time fall detection, potentially improving the safety and well-being of individuals prone to falls.
